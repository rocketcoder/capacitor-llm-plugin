== Purpose
This capacitorjs plugin allows you to use on device llms like gemma-2b for inferencing.  This repo contains two projects.  
- A capacitorjs plugin that wraps MediaPipe and exposes the llm inferening capabilties.
- A capacitorjs react app that demos the usage of the plugin.

Currently the plugin is only available for iOS, Android is coming soon.

== Setup
You need to update the iOS project to include the gemma-2b models.  The gemma model must be added to the build phase.
